# How to check if Internet Service Provider assigns you a public IP address?

## What is Public IP address?

All IPv4 addresses can be divided into two major groups: global (or public, external) — those that are used on the Internet, and private (or local, internal) addresses — those that are used in the local area network (LAN).

A public IP address is an IP address that is used to access the Internet. Public IP addresses can be routed on the Internet, unlike private addresses.

The presence of a public IP address on your router will allow you to organize your own server (VPN, FTP, WEB, etc.), remote access to your computer, video surveillance cameras, and get access to them from anywhere on the global network.
