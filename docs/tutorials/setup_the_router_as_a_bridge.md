# Can I set up the router as a bridge so that it works like I am connecting to my main router directly?

Yes, GL.iNet routers work in router mode by default, which will create a separated subnet for you. However, you can change its network mode so that it can behave like an extender without DHCP.

1. Access the web Admin Panel via 192.168.8.1
2. Go to **MORE SETTINGS** -> **Network Mode**.
3. Change the network mode to **Access Point**, **Extender** or **WDS**.
