# OpenVPN, TCP vs UDP

GL.iNet router's OpenVPN Server supports both TCP and UDP protocols. What's the difference?

TCP is more reliable, but less speed. UDP is faster but less reliable.

If you need a fast and constant data transmission for an application to work properly, UDP is a better choice. Otherwise, TCP is a stable and reliable protocol for transferring data and not losing any of it along the way. UDP is more suitable for gaming, streaming or using VoIP services. TCP is more suitable for emailing, web browsing and file transfer.

We recommend trying the UDP protocol first and only switching to TCP if you experience any issues.
