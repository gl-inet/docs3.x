# How to use VPN and DNS encryption to protect your privacy with GL.iNet router?

Privacy matters. No one likes to be watched or tracked â€“ even if they have nothing to hide. VPN can protect your privacy.

## What is a VPN?

VPN(virtual private network), it creates a secure tunnel for your data between your device and the Internet. It protect you from online snooping, interference, and censorship.

## Setup VPN on GL.iNet router

GL.iNet router has pre-installed two VPN protocols: WireGuard and OpenVPN. There are many [articles talk about their comparison](https://www.google.com/search?q=openvpn+vs+wireguard&sxsrf=AOaemvLFXOIOcZPQ9hw26cc31ar0Yac1tA%3A1633663082696&ei=arhfYa33KaqIwbkPuJGAwAE&ved=0ahUKEwit1Oed7bnzAhUqRDABHbgIABgQ4dUDCA4&oq=openvpn+vs+wireguard&gs_lcp=Cgdnd3Mtd2l6EAxKBAhBGABQAFgAYKYjaABwAngAgAEAiAEAkgEAmAEA&sclient=gws-wiz){target="_blank"}, it depends on your personal choice.

For WireGuard, there are [some WireGuard service providers](../wireguard_client#wireguard-providers) we haved tested, then please refer to [Setup WireGuard Client](../wireguard_client).
