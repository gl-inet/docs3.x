It is important to note you should have your router completely boot up before you perform a **reset**. Don't start any **reset** once the power is pluged and the router still in the boot up stage. It will leads you to the uboot failsafe mode.

    On the left side of web Admin Panel -> MORE SETTINGS -> Revert Firmware

    **Note:** All your current settings, applications and data will be lost. The process will take about 3 minutes. DO NOT power off the router during this process.
