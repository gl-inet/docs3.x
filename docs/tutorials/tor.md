To use the Tor firmware:

## Versions and supported devices

We have several version of Tor firmware and here is the summary.

We have upgrade Tor firmware for the following models to v2.264 on 2017-11-24.

`AR150, AR300M, AR300M NAND, MT300N, MT300A, MT300N-V2 `

Now Tor firmware is generally by imagebuilder and you will be able to install from standard GLi software repositories using opkg. The source code is on [github](https://github.com/gl-inet/openwrt-files) now.

To modify and compile the Tor firmware by yourself, please refer to the following imagebuilders.

* [imagebuilder for AR150, AR300M, MiFi, 6416](https://github.com/gl-inet/imagebuilder-cc-ar71xx) based on OpenWrt CC 1505
* [imagebuilder for AR300M NAND](https://github.com/gl-inet/imagebuilder-cc-ar71xx-nand) based on OpenWrt CC 1505
* [imagebuilder for MT300N, MT300A](https://github.com/gl-inet/imagebuilder-cc-ramips) based on OpenWrt CC 1505
* [imagebuilder for MT300N-V2](https://github.com/gl-inet/imagebuilder-lede-ramips) based on LEDE 17.01.4

### Version 1.4:

Only support `GL-AR150`, `GL-AR300M`, `GL-MT300N`, `GL-MT300A`, which has a `switch button` controlling whether you traffice should go through Tor or not.

**Most of these instructions are for version 1.4.**

### Version 1.3: 

Support `GL-AR150`,`GL.iNet6416`, `GL-AR300`. This firmware create two ssid: OpenWrt and Tor. If you conenct to OpenWrt you will have normal Internet. If you connect to Tor, you will be connect to Tor network. This firmware has a built-in UI based on Domino Pi which you can manage two SSIDs.

### Version 1.0 with LuCI:

Support `GL-MT300A` and `GL-MT300N`. This is the firmware created for MT300A and MT300N with LuCI. This firmware create two ssid: OpenWrt and Tor. If you conenct to OpenWrt you will have normal Internet. If you connect to Tor, you will be connect to Tor network. Connection from LAN port will always have Tor. LuCI is installed but there is no Domino Pi UI.

Note: If you have questions about versions, please ask here or in the forum.

## Download and Flashing the firmware to the device

All the firmwares is available at [here](https://dl.gl-inet.com/). Select your device model and select the type to `tor`. Download the latest firmware.

You need to refer to [Setup](../../setup/mini_router/first_time_setup/) for instructions to flash the firmware to the router. 

## Using the firmware UI

After you flash the firmware to your device, when it reboots you need to set up the device at `http://192.168.8.1`. 

`If` you need to connect via Wi-Fi, the default Wi-Fi password is `goodlife`.

NOTE:

**You need to move the hardware switch to the right side if you want to access the UI**. Otherwise you are connecting to the Tor network and will not be able to access the UI. This is for security reasons.

###First time setup
The first time you acess the setting UI, you will be asked to setup a new password immediatelly. Just choose a password and your TimeZone and submit. The device will `NOT` reboot in firmware 1.4.

NOTE: **This doesn't change your WiFi password. Change it later.**
