# LAN IP Setting

LAN IP is the IP address you will use to connect to this router. If it conflicts with your main router, you can change it in the UI.



## Default LAN IP
The default IP address of GL.iNet router is 192.168.8.1. 

## Change LAN IP
However, you can change the LAN IP address in the web admin page.Most of the routers use IP `192.168.0.1`, `192.168.1,1`, `192.168.1.254`, `10.10.1.1` etc. and subnet `255.255.255.0` (`/24`). If you want to connect GL.iNet router to another network, you have to ensure they have different IP address. Otherwise, you need to change the LAN IP of GL.iNet routers.

Click the `wireless icon` and then `LAN IP` to change the LAN IP.
