# Repeater Manager

All GL.iNet routers are equipped with repeater manager. When you use GL.iNet router as a repeater, repeater manager can enable the following features:



## Manage Saved Stations

All repeater stations (WISP/WDS) you connected to will be saved in the router. You can choose if they will be auto connected to or not.

## Auto Search for Available Saved Stations

The router will search among all saved stations and try to connect a valid station. If none of the saved stations can be connected, the router will disable sta mode to ensure your AP is ON
