## 1. 2.4G Wi-Fi

GL-MV1000W only has 2.4G Wi-Fi.

In `WIRELESS`, you can check the current status and change the settings of the wireless network created by the router. The wireless network can be turned on or off by switching the `ON/OFF` button.

**Wi-Fi Name (SSID)**: The name of the Wi-Fi.

**Wireless Security**: Wireless encryption method.

**Wi-Fi Key**: The password of the Wi-Fi, which must be at least 6 characters. We suggest you to change it when you receive the router.

**SSID Visibility**: Whether to hide the SSID or not.

**Wi-Fi Mode**: You could select 802.11b/g/n or 802.11g or 802.11b.

**Bandwidth**: You could select 20/40MHz or 40MHz or 20MHz.

**Channel**: The router will not choose the best channel itself. You need to choose a channel manually. If your router is used as a Wi-Fi repeater, the channel will be fixed according to the connected wireless network.

Click `Modify` to change the settings of the wireless network.

Click `Channel Optimization` will automatically select the most suitable channel according to the current environment.

## 2. Dongle

Starting from firmware version 3.100, users could add Wi-Fi to GL-MV1000W by plug a Wi-Fi dongle. 

Here is a list of supported dongles that we had tested before. 

| Driver                                 | Dongle        | Tested |
| -------------------------------------- | ------------- | ------ |
| RTL8811AU/RTL8821AU                    | AWUS036ACS    | Yes    |
| RTL8812AU                              | AWUS036AC     | Yes    |

You can buy these dongles from our [store](https://store.gl-inet.com/search?type=article%2Cpage%2Cproduct&q=dongle*){target="_blank"} or other channels.

When you insert the dongle, you will see the dongle under `WIRELESS`.

Click `Modify` to change the settings of the wireless network.

## Guest Wi-Fi

Guest Wi-Fi is turned off by default, you can turn on it for visitors. Guest Wi-Fi is separated from the default Wi-Fi. That is, you can only access the Internet in Guest Wi-Fi, not the web Admin Panel.
