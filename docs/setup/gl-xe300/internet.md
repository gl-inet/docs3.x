## 1. Cable

Connect the router to the modem or main router via Ethernet cable to access the Internet. 

*Note: Before plugging the Ethernet cable into the WAN port of the router, you can click `Use as LAN` to set the WAN port as a LAN port. That is useful when you are using the router as a [repeater](#2-repeater). As a result, you can have one more LAN port.*

![cable](https://static.gl-inet.com/docs/en/3/setup/share/internet/cable_section_of_internet.png){class="glboxshadow"}

Plug the Ethernet cable into the WAN port of the router. The information of your connection will be shown on the Cable section. DHCP is the default protocol. You can click `Modify` to change the protocol.

### DHCP

DHCP is the default and most common protocol. It doesn't require any manual configuration.

![dhcp](https://static.gl-inet.com/docs/en/3/setup/share/internet/dhcp_method.png){class="glboxshadow"}

### Static

Static is required if your Internet Service Provider (ISP) has provided a fixed IP address for you or you want to configure the network information such as IP address, Gateway, Netmask manually.

The current settings will be automatically filled once you choose Static. Change it according to your needs and then click `Apply`.

### PPPoE

PPPoE is required by many Internet Service Providers (ISP). Generally, your ISP will give you a modem and provide you a username & password that you needed when you are creating the Internet connection.

Under PPPoE protocol, enter your username and password, then click `Apply`.

## 2. Repeater

Using Repeater means connecting the router to another existing wireless network, e.g. when you are using free Wi-Fi in a hotel or cafe.

It works in WISP (Wireless Internet Service Provider) mode by default, which means that the router will create its own subnet and act as a firewall to protect you from the public network.

In Repeater section, click `Scan` to search for the available wireless networks nearby.

![scan Wi-Fi](https://static.gl-inet.com/docs/en/3/setup/share/internet/repeater_scan.png){class="glboxshadow"}

Choose a SSID from the drop-down list and enter its password. You can also enable the **Remember** button to save the current chose wireless network. Finally, click `Join`.

## 3. 3G/4G Modem

GL-XE300 has a built-in 3G/4G modem. It has different options of 3G/4G module which you can choose before purchase.

Some SIM cards may need to be activated the first time you use them, so please activate them in your phone before using them in your router.

We recommend to turn off the router first, insert the SIM card, and then turn it on again.

Normally, when the router is powered on, after a while, it will automatically recognize the SIM card and establish a connection.

## 4. Tethering

Using a USB cable to share network from your smartphone to the router is called Tethering. Host-less modem works in Tethering during the setup of the modem as well.

For host-less modem tethering, plug it into the USB port of the router.

For iPhone tethering:

1. Connect iPhone to the USB port of the router. It will pop up a message asking to trust this computer? Click "Trust" to contine. Because we are connecting the iPhone to the router, so here is to TRUST the router.

    ![trust this computer](https://static.gl-inet.com/docs/en/3/setup/share/internet/tethering/iphone_trust_this_computer.png){class="glboxshadow"}

2. Go to iPhone -> Settings -> Personal Hotspot -> Turn on Allow Others to Join.

    ![turn on allow others to join](https://static.gl-inet.com/docs/en/3/setup/share/internet/tethering/iphone_hotspot_allow_others_to_join.png){class="glboxshadow"}
