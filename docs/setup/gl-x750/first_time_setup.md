Search for the SSID of the router in your device and input the default password: ***goodlife***.

## 3. Access the web Admin Panel

Open a web browser (we recommend Chrome, firefox) and visit [http://192.168.8.1](http://192.168.8.1). You will be directed to the initial setup of the web Admin Panel. 

### 1) Language Setting

You need to choose the display language of the Admin Panel. Currently, our routers support **English**, **简体中文**, **繁體中文**, **Deutsch**, **Français**, **Español**, **Italiano** **日本語**, **한국어** and **Русский**.

*Note: If your browser always redirects to LuCI (http://192.168.8.1/cgi-bin/luci), you can  visit: [http://192.168.8.1/index](http://192.168.8.1/index) instead of [http://192.168.8.1](http://192.168.8.1).*

### 2) Admin Password Setting

There is no default password for the Admin Panel. You have to set your own password, which must be at least 5 characters. Then, click `Submit` to proceed.

*Note: This password is for this web Admin Panel and the embedded Linux system. It will not change your Wi-Fi password.*

### 3) Admin Panel

After the initial setup, you will enter the web Admin Panel of the router. It allows you to check the status and manage the settings of the router.
