# WIRELESS

On the left side of web Admin Panel -> WIRELESS

In `WIRELESS`, you can check the current status and change the settings of the wireless network created by the router. The wireless network can be turned on or off by switching the `ON/OFF` button.

**Wi-Fi Name (SSID)**: The name of the Wi-Fi.

**Wi-Fi Key**: The password of the Wi-Fi, which must be at least 6 characters. We suggest you to change it when you receive the router.

**Channel**: The router will not choose the best channel itself. You need to choose a channel manually. If your router is used as a Wi-Fi repeater, the channel will be fixed according to the connected wireless network.

**Speed**: The wireless speed of the router.

**TX Power (dBm)**: It specifies the signal strength. The default value is 20 (Strongest).
