There is a video tutorial about the setup, please check out [here](#video-tutorial).


## 1. Power on

Plug the Type-C power cable into the power port of the router. Make sure you are using a standard **5V/3A** power adapter. Otherwise it may cause malfunction.

*Note: Hot plug for TF card is **not** supported. If you want to use TF card, please insert before powering on the router.*

## 2. Connect

You can connect to the router via Ethernet cable or Wi-Fi.

*Note: This step only connects your devices to the local area network (LAN) of the router. You cannot access the Internet currently. In order to connect to the Internet, please finish the setup procedures below and then follow [Internet](../internet) to set up an Internet connection.*

### Connect via LAN

Connect your device to the LAN port of the router via Ethernet cable.

### Connect via Wi-Fi
Search for the SSID of the router in your device and input the default password: ***goodlife***.

*Note: The SSID was printed on the bottom label of the router with the following formats:*

- **GL-MT1300-XXX**
- **GL-MT1300-XXX-5G**

## 3. Access the web Admin Panel

Open a web browser (we recommend Chrome, firefox) and visit [http://192.168.8.1](http://192.168.8.1). You will be directed to the initial setup of the web Admin Panel.

### 1) Language Setting

You need to choose the display language of the Admin Panel. Currently, our routers support **English**, **简体中文**, **繁體中文**, **Deutsch**, **Français**, **Español**, **Italiano** **日本語**, **한국어** and **Русский**.

*Note: If your browser always redirects to LuCI (http://192.168.8.1/cgi-bin/luci), you can  visit: [http://192.168.8.1/index](http://192.168.8.1/index) instead of [http://192.168.8.1](http://192.168.8.1).*

### 2) Admin Password Setting

There is no default password for the Admin Panel. You have to set your own password, which must be at least 5 characters. Then, click `Submit` to proceed.

*Note: This password is for this web Admin Panel and the embedded Linux system. It will not change your Wi-Fi password.*

### 3) Admin Panel

After the initial setup, you will enter the web Admin Panel of the router. It allows you to check the status and manage the settings of the router.
