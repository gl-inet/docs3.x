# 	GL-MT300N-V2

The best selling mini router.



MT300N-V2 is an upgraded version of MT300N. The differences include:

* RAM is doubled to 128MB 
* WiFi performance is improved using MTK proprietary driver. This driver doesn't support monitoring mode. But it support layer 2 bridging for all kinds of AP, which is not the case of opensource drivers.
* Opensource wifi drivers also work but it has some bugs and cause kernel panic. This problem was never solved by the community.  
* No PoE options.
